##Find All Duplicates

Write a function (or static method in the case of Java) that accepts a list of integers and returns a list of only those integers that appear more than once.


Describe Different Approaches to Solving This Problem

Describe the two different ways to figure out all of the duplicate values of a list of integers in english. The first solution is the nested loop solution. The second solution is to use a dictionary or a map (similar to the containsPair method we wrote in class. Describe both in as much detail as you can (with no code) and describe the trade-offs between the two solutions.
